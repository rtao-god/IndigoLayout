        Before submitting your issue, please do the following:
        
        1. Make sure you're running Windows. If you're using macOS, Linux, WSL/WSL2, or a Docker container using Linux, then you probably want [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (this is NVM _for Windows_).
        1. Review the [common issues and resolutions](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/wiki/Common-Issues) wiki page.
        1. Search existing issues to see if your issue has already been opened/closed (help prevent duplicates).
        1. Remember, there is a [wiki](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/wiki) that answers questions about installation types, building from source, and project philosophy concerns.
        1. **[Read the README](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)**. We took the time to write it for you. Many people ignore this.
        1. If your issue is actually a question, please use the [discussions page](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/discussions) so the whole community can help.
        1. If you're seeking commercial help or requesting something you really need for work, please consider sponsoring the change/fix.
